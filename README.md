## Introduction

This repository contains a 3D model project for a SMART 3D AIR FRYER, created using Blender. The model showcases the design and functionality of the air fryer, providing a detailed view of its components and features. This project is part of my ongoing practice in 3D modeling and design, aiming to create realistic and functional models that can be used in various applications.
